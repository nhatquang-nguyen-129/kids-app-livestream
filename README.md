KidsPlaza Livestream Service powers the in-app livestream feature of our Ecommerce platform, enabling real-time product showcasing, interactive shopping experiences, and direct customer engagement through video.

This microservice manages the creation, scheduling, and lifecycle of livestream sessions. It integrates seamlessly with the user system (to manage host permissions), product catalog (to attach featured items), notification services (for push alerts), and third-party video streaming platforms (e.g., Agora, Amazon IVS). The architecture is built to support modular expansion including real-time chat, reactions, analytics, and replay features.
